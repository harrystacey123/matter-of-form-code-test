## Harry Stacey's take home coding challenge

I used Sass as my CSS pre-processor, and React Slick as my carousel plugin for this project. 

The styling for the project took longer than I thought, mainly because I found myself conflicting with the stylesheets in the Slick Carousel node_module files. Once I realised this it was less complicated. 

I'd say my finished product is not perfect, but overall I am pleased with my work.
